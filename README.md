# Your Guide To Typescript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. As a developer, learning TypeScript can make your code more maintainable and scalable, especially for larger projects. With TypeScript, you can catch errors at compile-time rather than at runtime, which can save you time and effort in debugging. Additionally, your editor will gain the superpower of autocomplete, which can help you write code faster and with fewer errors.

## How to use this repo

The lessons in this repository are designed to be used in person and consist of a mix of explanations and questions posed to students. Each lesson is kept short, lasting only 10-15 minutes. After each lesson, there is a small set of self-study problems for students to complete. The goal of these lessons is to prepare students to use TypeScript professionally, providing them with the practice they need to become proficient in the language.
